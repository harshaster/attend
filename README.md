This is a simple python server to record attendance built using flask.

Idea is to serve the app over a network and ask users to go to app url and record their attendance.
If the user is not in database, one can also register on the spot.

Application runs smoothly in terms of what it is intended to do.
The only problem I faced with this is that it is not scalable. I made this one overnight for a collge seminar attendance. (Did not turn out nice.) I am not updating this now. If you are interested, most welcome.

Thanks
